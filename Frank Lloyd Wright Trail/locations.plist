		<string>American System Built Homes</string>
		<key>details</key>
		<string>In a career spanning seven decades, Frank Lloyd Wright took special interest in creating architect-designed homes for moderate and low income families.  In the January 1938 issue of “Architectural Forum,” he commented, “I would rather solve the small house problem than build anything else I can think of…” Using his own criteria, these small homes designed for clients who could afford little, are among Wright’s greatest masterpieces. To promote, protect and preserve the heritage of Frank Lloyd Wright in his native state of Wisconsin, is the mission of Frank Lloyd Wright® Wisconsin. Since its inception in 1990, the organization has worked tirelessly to honor that statement. For all who value the legacy of Wright’s architecture we know you will agree with our mission.</string>

		<key>details</key>
		<string>A landmark in church architecture from 1951, Wright’s ship-like design for the First Unitarian Society, with a sharp prow jutting out from the earth towards the sky, offers a sense of transcendence, one he would often enjoy as a member of the congregation. His extensive use of copper and glass throughout the building provide a timeless feel to the unorthodox house of worship.</string>

		<string>The SC Johnson Administration Building was the first Frank Lloyd Wright designed for SC Johnson. The Research Tower opened in 1950.</string>

		<string>SC Johnson Administration Building</string>
		<key>details</key>
		<string>Far outside the corridors of high-tech industry and startup spaces, the SC Johnson company headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin, still provides a dashing vision of the modern American workplace, despite having recently celebrated its 75th anniversary. The SC Johnson Administration Building, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1936, eschews business clichés: workers are greeted by a streamlined, muscular exterior made from ribbons of glass and brick, more campus than corporate, before entering a light-filled interior, with rows of organic, curved columns creating an abstract forest surrounding the secretary pool. The 15-story Research Tower, completed in 1950, was built on a &quot;taproot&quot; system. A core of elevators, heating, and ductwork formed a spine at the center on the tower, supported by a foundation sunk 54-feet-deep into the ground. Disc-shaped mezzanines branched off the core, alternating with full sized, 40-foot wide floors. Walls of horizontal Pyrex tubes, the same used in the Administration Building, let in sunlight but block the view. The effect is of a tree enclosed in glass.</string>

		<string>Wright’s longtime home and studio, named after a Welsh term that means “Shining Brow,” is an icon of Prairie School design that saw numerous tragedies and rebirths over the decades as the architect continually renovated, rebuilt and expanded. Set on a 700-acre estate in the rolling hills of Spring Green where he grew up, it was the site where he created and designed many of his masterpieces beginning in 1911 and contains a collection of Wright-designed structures.</string>

		<string>Wingspread</string>

		<string>In 1936, Herbert Fisk Johnson, Jr. (1899-1978) commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to design a new administration building for S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., (also known as Johnson Wax), the family business which has since been renamed SC Johnson, A Family Company.  Johnson loved the plan so much he later commissioned Wright to design his new home. Completed in 1939, Wright called the 14,000-foot creation Wingspread, because its four wings embrace the prairie, while the roof over the central Great Hall soars skyward.</string>

		<string>A sprawling, curved convention center on the shores of Lake Monona in Madison, this building was a posthumous addition to the Wright canon, rejected by officials during the architect’s lifetime, but finally approved via a referendum put local voters in the early ‘90s. The curvilinear “dream civic center,” which recalls the shape of the Guggenheim, was first proposed by Wright in 1938, and was a project he constantly altered and updated throughout his life. His former apprentice Anthony Puttnam would finish the designs for the interior before it was finally completed in 1997.</string>

Built in the town of Richland Center, where Wright was born, this offers a rare example of a project the architect designed in the late 1910’s that’s still standing.</string>
